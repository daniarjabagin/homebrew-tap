  caveats <<~EOS
    Headroom is ad-hoc signed and not notarized by Apple yet, so this cask removes the
    com.apple.quarantine attribute from Headroom.app after installing it. Without that,
    Gatekeeper would block the first launch.

    Headroom updates itself with Sparkle; every update is verified with an EdDSA signature.
    Because the signature is ad-hoc, macOS asks again for Keychain access to
    "Claude Code-credentials" after each update: choose Always Allow.
